        <p>Nowadays, motorcycles are a popular form of transportation. While motorcycles are most frequently
        used casually, the sport of motorcycle racing is also highly sought-after, for cyclist hoping to
        race, as well as people hoping to watch.</p>
        <p>
            MotoGP—known officially as the FIM Grand Prix Road Racing World Championship—holds 19 races in 15 different countries, including one event in the US, the Grand Prix of The Americas in Austin, Texas.

            Motorcycle racing in North America began in 1903 with the formation of the Federation of American Motorcyclists in New York City.
            There are about as many forms of motorcycle racing as there are of automobile racing. The main types are road racing, trials, speedway, motocross, drag racing, ice racing, and hill climbs.

            In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle (German: Motorrad). Excelsior Motor Company, originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry, England, began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896.

            In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.

            As the world moves off fossil fuels and big bike brands come out with their own electric motorcycle, it’s fair to say that the future of motorcycles is electric.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motorcycle companies are working toward sustainable electric motorcycles, while considering the riders' experience.
            The first wave of electric motorcycle offerings were expensive and limited in their riding capacity. However, futuristic motorcycle brands, like Damon, have really pushed the envelope in terms of motorcycle technology. As a result, so many of the predictions we expected for the future of motorcycle technology are already becoming a reality in 2023.
