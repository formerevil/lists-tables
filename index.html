        This is an informative page about motorcycles. Motorcycles were created in the 18th century in order to make letter carrying easier and faster. Invented by King Henry the 8th, this invention proved to be less effective than a cart when it came to mail delivery.
        In the late 1800s, motorcycles began to be used by salesmen. It gave them an air of reliability, which helped their sales greatly. Then, the view of motorcycles shifted, as they did not help salesmen as much as they hurt them.
