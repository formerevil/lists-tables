    <p style="color: lavender" class="georgia"> In the beginning there was an empty darkness. The only thing in this void was Nyx, a bird with black wings. With the wind she laid a golden egg and for ages she sat upon this egg.
        Finally, life began to stir in the egg and out of it rose Eros, the god of love. One half of the shell rose into the air and became the sky and the other became the Earth.

    </p>
    <p style="color: lavender" class="georgia">
        Eros named the sky Uranus and the Earth he named Gaia. Then Eros made them fall in love.
        Uranus and Gaia had many children together and eventually they had grandchildren.
        Some of their children become afraid of the power of their children. Kronus, in an effort to protect himself, swallowed his children when they were still infants. However, his wife Rhea hid their youngest child.
        She gave him a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed, thinking it was his son.

    </p>
    <p style="color: lavender" class="georgia">Once the child, Zeus, had reached manhood his mother instructed him on how to trick his father to give up his brothers and sisters. Once this was accomplished the children fought a mighty war against their father.
        After much fighting the younger generation won. With Zeus as their leader, they began to furnish Gaia with life and Uranus with stars.

        Soon the Earth lacked only two things: man and animals. Zeus summoned his sons Prometheus (fore-thought) and Epimetheus (after-thought). He told them to go to Earth and create men and animals and give them each a gift.
    </p>
    <p style="color: lavender" class="georgia">
        The sons went to Earth and Prometheus brought with him fire. He then decided to attach a steam engine to a velocipede. After years of experimentation, he developed a working model of a two-wheeled motor vehicle.
        Around the same time, two men named Michaux and Perreaux developed a similar steam-powered velocipede prototype.
